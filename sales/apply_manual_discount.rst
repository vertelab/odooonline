   single: Discount on quotation

Apply discount on quotation
===========================

Allowing discounts on quotations is a common sales practice to improve
the chances to convert the prospect into a customer, adding discounts on
the quotation encourage the prospect to close the deal quickly.

Business case
-------------

My company would like to send a quotation for an *iPad Mini* at a sales
price of *320 USD* per *iPad* at a **5% discounted** price.

Configuration
-------------

Assumed that the **Sales Management** application installed.

Discounts
~~~~~~~~~

In this business case, we would like to offer 5% discount to our
customer on the sale price.

**Discounts** feature can be activated from **Configuration / Settings**
, under the **Pricing** section.

Create a quotation
------------------

Quotation can be created from **Sales / Order / Quotations**, click on
**CREATE** button to create a new quotation, select customer and add
product *iPad Mini* on the quotation, the default price you will see is
320$.

Apply discount
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the discount will not be applied as we choose to apply manual
discount, to apply 5% discount enter 5 in the **Discount (%)** field for
iPad Mini product in the sales order line.

.. tip:: The discount should be entered between 0 to 100, it computes
  discount in percentage. The price will change automatically when you
  enter the discount.

Printing quotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discount column will be appeared on the quotation when you have applied
discount on any of the product on quotation. Don’t be surprised if you
don’t see the discount column on the quotation, which means that you
have not applied discount on any of the product on quotation as you
don’t want to offer discount to your customer.

.. tip:: All the taxes applicable on the product will be computed on the
  discounted product price (i.e. Taxes will be computed on **Subtotal**)
